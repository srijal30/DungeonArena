# DungeonArena 
*Final Name TBD* <br>
Work in progress, final release TBD.

## Description
PVP arena based in a dungeon where multiple players across devices can join and fight to increase their rank on the leaderboard (which is based off kills)

## How to Play
In the future there will be a itch.io page and dedicated server for this game. If you want to play the game in its current state, you will have to run it locally.

Make sure that you have [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) installed on your computer. Once you do that, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/srijal30/DungeonArena.git
```

Then, open the godot editor and then import the repository's `project.godot`. Select the project (it should be called RPG) and then click the run button on the right column. Make sure to run it twice: once for the server and once for the client. You can then connect as many clients as you want ðŸ˜€. If you want people from other networks to join, you have to forward port 58008 and give then your IP address. Maximum of 10 players.
